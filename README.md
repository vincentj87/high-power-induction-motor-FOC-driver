# High Power BLDC Motor Driver with Field-Oriented Control (FOC)

This repository contains an ongoing project for a high-power BLDC motor driver, capable of handling up to 92V. The motor driver implements the **Field-Oriented Control (FOC)** commutation method for enhanced efficiency. Additionally, it integrates **Maximum Torque Per Amp (MTPA)** control to optimize performance.

## Key Features:
- **Field-Oriented Control (FOC)**: For efficient commutation, reducing power losses and improving motor performance.
- **MTPA (Maximum Torque Per Amp)**: Optimizes motor operation for maximum torque output with minimal current draw.
- **High Power Handling**: Supports up to 92V for heavy-duty applications.
  
## Components:
All components included in the Bill of Materials (BOM) file are readily available through **LCSC** for easy sourcing.

## PCB Design:
- The controller PCB is designed for a **2-layer FR4** board.
- The MOSFET array is implemented on a **1-layer aluminum PCB** to maximize heat dissipation, particularly under heavy load conditions.
